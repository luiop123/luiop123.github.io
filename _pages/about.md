I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.cug.edu.cn/), [China University of Geosciences](https://www.cug.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, deep learning,spatiotemporal forecasting.

I was very fortunate to do scientific research on multimodal related topics in the laboratory of Liu Yuan Yuan, China University of Geosciences.

I was also very fortunate to do scientific research on topics related to high resolution remote sensing image classification in the lab of Mr. Hao Guocheng at China University of Geosciences.

I have won various competition awards, such as:

RoboCup - National First Prize in Industrial Measurement.

RoboCup - National second prize for 3D recognition project.

MathorCup:Mathematical Modeling Challenge Competition for High Schools:National Third Prize.
